Hey my name is Irfan Campara!
Im doing undergrad CS at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.
On this guthub I'll store class assignments, personal projects and whatever else.
Some of my interests include CS, Quant Careers, Investment banking and AI/ML.
I hope you can see some of my projects, and have a wonderful day.
