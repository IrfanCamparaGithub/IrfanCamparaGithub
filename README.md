Hey, my name is Irfan Campara! I'm currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in Computer Science at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. This GitHub repository will showcase my class assignments, personal projects, and various other endeavors.

I have a deep interest in C++, C#, Spring Boot, and low latency development for high-frequency trading. Additionally, I'm passionate about exploring careers in technology, quantitative careers, investment banking, and AI/ML.

I hope you enjoy browsing through my projects, and have a wonderful day!
